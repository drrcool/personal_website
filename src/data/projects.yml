    title: "Tooling to Understand Potential Feature Reach"
    description: "The CE device ecosystem is a complex system with many moving parts. I build tooling to help understand the reach of potential new features by measuring the cardinality of an arbitrary set of technical requirements and logged device capabilities.  Data volume exceeds 3 trillion rows of data per day. The dashboard is fronted by a custom React UI and powered through ThetaSketch in Druid.  Measured reach values are augmented with ML forecasts into the future to help prioritize feature development."
